The project focuses on longitudinal tracking of strain transfer in the maternal vaginal and fecal samples
from the second to third trimesters of pregnancy to postpartum. Additionally, strain transfer from postpartum vaginal and fecal samples to infants at least 3 months of age was assessed.
The focus for the latter was identifying differences in strain transfer between C-section and vaginally delivered.
The MisFet pipeline was used for the initial analysis. The followup statistical analysis performed is present in the code in this repo.
